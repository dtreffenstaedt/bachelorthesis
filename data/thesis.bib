	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The production and acceleration mechanisms of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) of energy >1020 eV, clearly beyond the GZK cutoff limit, remain unclear, which points to the exotic nature of the phenomena. Recent observations of extragalactic neutrinos may indicate that the source of UHECRs is an extragalactic supermassive black hole (SMBH). We demonstrate that ultraefficient energy extraction from a rotating SMBH driven by the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) could indeed fit the bill. We envision ionization of neutral particles, such as neutron beta decay, skirting close to the black hole horizon that energizes protons to over 1020 eV for an SMBH of mass 109M⊙ and magnetic field 104 G. Applied to the Galactic center SMBH, we have a proton energy of order ≈1015.6 eV that coincides with the knee of the cosmic-ray spectra. We show that large γz factors of high-energy particles along the escaping directions occur only in the presence of an induced charge of the black hole, which is known as the Wald charge in the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is remarkable that the process requires neither an extended acceleration zone nor fine-tuning of accreting-matter parameters. Further, this leads to certain verifiable constraints on the SMBH’s mass and magnetic field strength as the source of UHECRs. This clearly makes the ultraefficient regime of the MPP one of the most promising mechanisms for fueling the UHECR powerhouse.}

	abstract={The speed gain of a test mass from taking a gravitational slingshot around a celestial object (scattering centre) increases with the latter's speed and compactness (stronger deflection of the mass' trajectory becomes possible without it hitting the surface of the object). The black holes (BHs) in a tight binary (consisting of two black holes; we are not considering X-ray binaries), themselves moving at relativistic speeds, represent optimal scattering centres. Therefore, a subpopulation of accreting matter particles, swept up into chaotic orbits around a BH binary, might repeatedly take slingshots and become accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (as seen by observers on Earth), ultimately escaping from the binary, as well as the fate of being devoured by a BH. The escaped particles can plausibly be observed on Earth as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Investigating such a possibility would require general relativistic slingshot formulae due to the high speeds involved and the close encounters with BHs. We derive them in this paper and show that the percentage gain per slingshot in a particle's Lorentz factor remains undiminished even as the particle energizes up, thus demonstrating that the slingshot mechanism can in principle accelerate particles to extreme energies.},

	abstract = {In the last fifteen years radio detection made it back to the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers, firstly, due to the installation and successful operation of digital radio experiments and, secondly, due to the quantitative understanding of the radio emission from atmospheric particle cascades. The radio technique has an energy threshold of about 100PeV, which coincides with the energy at which a transition from the highest-energy galactic sources to the even more energetic extragalactic cosmic rays is assumed. Thus, radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic particles and ultra-high-energy extragalactic particles of all types. Recent measurements by various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, Tunka-Rex, and others have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other established techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum, which is one of the best estimators for the composition of the primary cosmic rays. The scientific potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, because this combination of complementary detectors can significantly increase the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This increase in accuracy is crucial for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or different types of nuclei, because showers initiated by these particles differ in average depth of the shower maximum and in the ratio between the amplitude of the radio signal and the number of muons. In addition to air-shower measurements, the radio technique can be used to measure particle cascades in dense media, which is a promising technique for detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for the radio emission by neutrino-induced particle cascades in ice. In the next years these two sub-fields of radio detection of cascades in air and in dense media will likely merge, because several future projects aim at the simultaneous detection of both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and simultaneously provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Moreover, detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This review provides an introduction to the physics of radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments and their instrumental properties, and a summary of methods for reconstructing the most important air-shower properties from radio measurements. Finally, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed.}

	abstract = {Measuring radio emission from air showers provides excellent opportunities to directly measure all air shower properties, including the shower development. To exploit this in large-scale experiments, a simple and analytic parameterization of the distribution of the radio signal at ground level is needed. Data taken with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) show a complex two-dimensional pattern of pulse powers, which is sensitive to the shower geometry. Earlier parameterizations of the lateral signal distribution have proven insufficient to describe these data. In this article, we present a parameterization derived from air-shower simulations. We are able to fit the two-dimensional distribution with a double Gaussian, requiring five fit parameters. All parameters show strong correlations with air shower properties, such as the energy of the shower, the arrival direction, and the shower maximum. We successfully apply the parameterization to data taken with LOFAR and discuss implications for air shower experiments.}

We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.}",
